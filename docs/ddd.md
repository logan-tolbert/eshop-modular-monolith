# Domain Driven Design

## Analysis

### Domain Analysis

- Domain models
- Application use cases
- Rest API endpoints
- Underlying data structures

### Technical Analysis

- Architecture style
- Patterns and principles
- Libraries / packages
- Project structure

## Patterns

### Shared Kernal Pattern

A small subset of the domain model is shared between multiple bounded contexts or modules
- includes common data structures, utility classes, or services that multiple parts of the application need to use
- ensures consistency and resduces duplication between different modules
